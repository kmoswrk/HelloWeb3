# .env.template
# This file serves as a template for your .env file.
# Copy this to .env (which is gitignored) and fill in your actual values.

# --- Core GCP Configuration ---
# REQUIRED: Your Google Cloud Project ID
GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id-here"

# REQUIRED: The primary GCP region for your resources
GCP_REGION="us-central1" # Or your preferred default

# --- gcloud CLI Specific Configuration ---
# These help the gcloud CLI pick up the project and region automatically
# if they are set in the environment.
# IMPORTANT: Set these to the same values as GCP_PROJECT_ID and GCP_REGION above.
CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT="your-gcp-project-id-here"
CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION="us-central1" # Should match GCP_REGION

# --- Terraform Specific Configuration ---
# These allow Terraform to automatically pick up project and region as input variables.
# IMPORTANT: Set these to the same values as GCP_PROJECT_ID and GCP_REGION above.
TF_VAR_gcp_project_id="your-gcp-project-id-here"
TF_VAR_gcp_region="us-central1" # Should match GCP_REGION

# --- Optional GCP Zone ---
# If your application or specific gcloud/terraform commands require a zone:
# GCP_ZONE="us-central1-a" # Should be within GCP_REGION
# If using GCP_ZONE, you might also want to set these for gcloud and Terraform:
# CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE="us-central1-a" # Should match GCP_ZONE
# TF_VAR_gcp_zone="us-central1-a"       # Should match GCP_ZONE

# --- Application Secrets & Configuration ---
# REQUIRED: Your PolygonScan API Key
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY="your-polygonscan-api-key-here"

# --- Optional: Terraform Backend Configuration ---
# If you use a GCS backend for Terraform state and create the bucket manually:
# TF_STATE_BUCKET="your-gke-tf-state-bucket-name"

# --- Optional: Grafana Admin Password (for local testing) ---
# If you run Grafana locally and need to set an initial admin password:
# GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD="a-very-strong-password"

# --- Optional: Docker Image Prefix ---
# Useful if you build and push Docker images to Google Artifact Registry.
# Replace 'your-gcp-project-id-here' and 'your-repo-name' accordingly.
# DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME_PREFIX="us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/your-gcp-project-id-here/your-repo-name"
DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME="us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/project-id/polygon-monitor-repo/polygon-monitor-app"

# --- Optional: Terraform Debug Logging ---
# For verbose output from Terraform commands:
# TF_LOG="DEBUG"
